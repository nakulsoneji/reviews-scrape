Helen,This laptop is great for my needs so far.,"For now I am giving it a 5 star rating.It is faster than my old duo core, it has more RAM and a bigger HD so that is a plus.For the price, it is a very good computer."
Grace,Nice PC with one problem,"This is a good value, easy to get going, fast....except....the keys are silver and the writing on the keys are faint. If you need to look at the keys to type, this is not for you. I can be frustrating to spend the extra time because the visibility isn't there."
Chris,Great computer,"Great computer. No complaints. I use it for online college work and business. I bought one for my wife last year and loved it, so when I needed a new one I looked for a HP Pavilian. This model seems to be the best quality and price."
Nautiguy,7 year old computer,"I don't know how long these computers have been sitting on the shelf or how computers 7 years old are still available. I did some research and windows 10 was installed in 2017. I don't know if these are refurbished or what they are and they don't come in HP packaging either. It's not that fast but faster than my old Pavillion I bought back in 2008. The SD card reader doesn't work and it isn't showing in the device manager which means there's no way of updating the driver because you need a device to do that. You can insert a known working SD card but nothing happens and YouTube and Google searches are useless because they all assume your SD reader is external or they tell you to update the driver or assign a drive letter but you need an installed device that shows in the device manager to do anything. The reason I bought this was to get a windows 10 pc with a built-in optical drive. I didn't want a windows 11 pc because everyone I know that has windows 11 says it's as bad as windows 8 was and probably won't be around very long. All that aside, the computer works as well as can be expected for what it is."
GMCd,Good laptop for your money,It is a good laptop with good ample memory and processor speed. The color is nice. The touch screen is very responsive even though it's something I don't use much.
A.,Would recommend this computer,This product was all I expected and more. I bought this computer to run 3D modeling programs. It has the hard drive capacity I was looking for. The 12GB of ram in addition to the 7th Gen i5 intel processor allows the computer to run extremely efficiently. Would recommend this computer.
Lars Isaacson,Extremely Slow,"We spent more money on this specific computer due to the faster processor and additional memory. Upon getting it home and opening it up, we were extremely disappointed in how slow the computer is. Web processors take forever to open, videos don't play smoothly. We've had it for several months and there has been no improvement. We have extremely fast wifi, our other computers work fine. We have not installed any software on it. I would guess it has something to do with this being a refurbished computer. I will not buy refurbished ever again. Additionally, for the money, I expected it to include Microsoft Office (to be fair, that was never stated anywhere) so it's basically useless for its intended purpose (to work from home)."
Reynord Stoute,Great Product,Great product. I use it for business and it works really good for what I do. If you're looking for an inexpensive but great laptop this is definitely a great choice
Amazon Customer,Alright laptop,"It worked really well for the first month, but now I am consistently having to reset the wireless in it. It gets the job done, but it can be extremely frustrating.I'd also add that this is a very large laptop, which it fine, but I definitely underestimated how large 15.6 inches was."
Omkara,Update: Owned for 2 years and notw it is dead,"Update May 2019: This laptop will no longer turn on. It says the main drive needs to be repaired and then nothing happens. I bought this laptop in March 2017, and it is dead by May 2019. That is ridiculous, this laptop has barley been used, as I graduated in July 2017. It has been kept up to date and maintained. My last HP laptop, bought from a staples for less money lasted for seven years, and only died because my dog knocked a glass of water on it with her tail. My HP desktop purchased at a Sam's Club is still going strong 10 years later. I am super disappointed in this purchase.I almost didn't order this laptop because of the reviews, but it has been great for me. It is not slow, I use it mainly for school and it has been great for me."
Lajuanna Peterson,Quality laptop,I like the laptop only thing missing is keyboard backlights
Tamara Green,Touch screen?,"So far so good, the only issue is I can't figure out how to access the touch screen aspect as it was advertised when I brought it"
Acqueme,Four Stars,Good product. Specs are what the seller said it was. Good for university!
Maritza,Dishonest sale,Not a touchscreen. I paid for a brand new computer and got a used one. Now its having hardware problems. Really dishonest.

Rahul Handoo,Value for money,Awesome and fast
Kirti Patel,"ap, connecticut","I bought this laptop about couple of weeks ago. I am very disappointed with it. The battery life is not even 4 hrs long and they advertise as 7 hrs. It also make lots of fan noise, even with only one program running. It supposed to be quite because of 12 GB RAM, but it's not. I spent $550 for it and it is a junk. I could have gone from BJ'S or Sams Club for same amount with lot better product."
L. D. Vega,Poor quality product and unreliable.,"One of the worst laptops I have owned. After a year of use, keyboard is broken. had it replaced. As of today, keyboard has broken again. Service outside the US is terrible and it is a pain to disassemble or service this laptop. Will never buy again. Strongly suggest you look at other brands like Dell, Lenovo or Acer."
Amazon Customer,Good deal for the features it has,I have started using this laptop from a week or so. This laptop made much difference into my day to day life. I got a good deal and I'm enjoying the features. I wouldn't have expected more than this.

Diane,"Great graphics, very responsive","Great graphics, very responsive. Don't like the Microsoft product screen that pops up when I log onto my computer. So much better than my old computer! Very happy with this laptop."
WH,"Not the best HP, has battery issues","Battery went bad within 6 months, then the power connector into the laptop starting playing up, it only works if fiddled enough."
Eddie Lo,nice little device,Great price. I got it for my g granddaughter who is a freshman in university.

Jim,This is more of a review of the seller than ...,This is more of a review of the seller than the product. The product description clearly lists this computer as a touch screen display more than once. Only to begin setup and find it is not a touchscreen and won't support touch.First real dissappointment with Amazon
Donna,Glad I brought It.,Love this Computer. Very lightweight. I use it only for school and other church assignments. Great for video sharing and downloading music.
Mave,Expensive Paperweight,Truly the biggest waste of money you can imagine. It is practically a paperweight. It's internet capabilities are garbage. 1gig in home internet speeds and this device is constantly running at under 1mb/s. I will never buy another HP computer.
Buffy1977,Lasted 3 months!,"Bought is for my husband in February 2017. It's now June 4th, 2017 and its not working. He has anti virus programs and everything but it suddenly died. Only got 3 months out of it and cannot return it. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N52ZY3L/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0"
The Squirrel Nurse,Bad deal,Sold to me as new but 2 years old and out of warranty. I keep having software issues! Amazon you can keep deleting this review but I will keep writing it.

Amazon Customer,What a piece of garbage.,"Wow. I completely regret buying this computer. I've had this computer for about 9 months and already about a dozen of the keys only work half the time and the equals/plus key barely ever works, which is a big problem when you are trying to write code. The keys that only work sometimes are getting worse too. They seem to work less consistently every day, and as a student I can't afford to send my computer off to be fixed because I have coursework that needs to be done every day. I'm just going to buy the parallel software for my Mac so I can run Windows OS on it and I'll throw this thing in the trash."
Mike S,Do not buy this piece of garbage,"I've had this machine for about a year. No gaming. Internet, some Excel... BASIC functions. Barely any downloads or memory usage.It is the slowest PC I've ever seen wake up. Chrome CONSTANTLY is unresponsive. It takes forever to do anything. I feel like I'm using a 1995 machine waiting fro dial up and for crap to load on the screen.My wife uses a Mac for work, jumped on this POS yesterday and asked me how in the hell I work on it. It's that bad.Do not buy this piece of garbage. If anyone here is reviewing it positively they're either lying or haven't even fired this disaster up."
Britt,Sceen hinges broke after 2 years. Expensive to repair.,"HP hinges break easily. Had it for two years and without ever dropping or bumping it, the hinges of the screen broke. If you google HP laptop and hinges, this seems to be a very common problem/design flaw. Repair runs $250 to $300 dollars."
Buckaroo Bob,"""2017 Newest HP"" ? -- ""Premium"" ?? -- NOT 2017 specs and NOPE.","No Full HD display. No SSD, nor 7200 RPM. No /ac wireless. No Gigabit Ethernet. Only one USB 3. No back-lit keyboard. Come on HP -- is this ""Premium"" ? New processor and DDR4, that is it. Look around -- for this price you can do WAY better."
Laura K. Hilton,Bloatware-laden piece of garbage,"This is the worst laptop I have ever purchased. It is constantly updating itself, adding new programs that I do not want that only slow it down. The first week I had the laptop, it was excruciatingly slow. I had to waste time searching internet forums to figure out what bloatware to delete to make the laptop actually function.Just now, it took the computer 10 minutes to start and an additional 7.5 minutes just to open google chrome to write this review (I timed it). The only things I need a laptop for are browsing the internet and Microsoft Word. You would think a laptop at this price could accomplish such simple tasks."
Thomas Jacobs,Ultra reliable. Photoshop friendly!,"Fast for a laptop, works well with photo shop I bought it in 2017 as a refurbished computer. I use it every day. The only issue I have is the shift key on the left side sticks and that was my fault due to a spilled soda. I use a separate keyboard now unless I am on the road."
Amazon Customer,SO FAR SO GOOD! I had an HP before and I was ...,"SO FAR SO GOOD!I had an HP before and I was really happy with it's reliability. I am really happy with my new laptop. Latest processor, large memorry and beautiful look. It works great. Super fast and quiet. I've had it for about two weeks and don't have any complaints. I'm enjoying my new HP."
Rob n Liz,It has been an excellent product. Great job,"Just received it. It has been an excellent product. Great job, HP!"
Coral Juliet,the only brand to buy,"The quality of this product is very good, After I bought it and use found no problems, I believe it is very durable.I often recommend friends to buy definitely worth it 100% satisfied!!!!!!

Michelle B,"great laptop for digital, gaming","No problems at all, love the laptop!"
