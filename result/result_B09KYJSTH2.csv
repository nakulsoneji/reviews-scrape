thk,Nice laptop for student/travel use with bundle portable SSD for additional storage,"Very light easy to use, large keyboard keys. Had problem with original computer not booting, contacted WOWPC directly and they furnished replacement in 4 days. Great to deal with and high recommend."
Morgan O'Donnell,Battery runs down quickly but over all it works great for me to do school work,"This computer is exactly what I was looking for, it has decent ram and is easy to use, it also has a backlit keyboard which is great. The battery runs down relatively quickly, probably in about 4 to 5 hours depending on how many apps are being used and whether the keyboard is lit. Over all a great computer but if you need to do work for an extended period of time with no access to an outlet then it isn’t for you."
Edward J.,HP 2022 laptop.,It was not what I expected. Window 11.
Mystery Ninja,Crapped out in 2 days,"Immediately upon opening the laptop it said the battery needed to be replaced. It still charged up, but then less than 2 days later it crashed and won’t even turn on when plugged in. I returned it, but was charged a $55 restocking fee because it had passed 30 days — since my daughter didn’t open it until Christmas (I bought it in November). Can’t trust this seller I guess."
lennox campbell,It's very fast and easy to use,I used this product to surf the internet write letters and download information and print same.
Teresa Wilson,A little disappointed,"Love the computer, it was exactly what I wanted. I was supposed to come with an external hard drive but when I received the computer I did not get the hard drive."
Colin J. Cummings,Solid machine,"This device was a gift for my son. However, it was very solid. Good build quality. 16GB RAM. He would like to add a second drive to augment the 256GB SSD drive. I don't think he has any complaints after 3 days of use. Upgraded to windows 11."
J. P. Cole,Never again,"Very bad seller!!!! And I blame Amazon for letting them sell as well!!!! Product is mediocre for a machine with 16GB OF RAM!!! Plus, I think this was used before and recycled since some applications show someone else's ID and emails come up! And lastly, instead of throwing in a 256GB hard drive as a normal part of the deal, you had to sign up for it?!?! And when I go to contact the seller, since Amazon shipped it, they can't do ANYTHING to help. Never again - this machine, this seller, and Amazon for a PC!!!"
D. A. R.,Battery,The battery life on the laptop stinks. It doesn't last very long. I have to change it every couple of hours.
CM,False Advertising,"This computer is a great deal but does not include the hard drive advertised. When calling into customer service the only solution was a complete refund. They were unable to fulfill the promised hard drive. The logic was I can re order and hope the hard drive was included next time if not I can do another full refund. This is the second laptop I'm buying through Amazon as the first was defective. You get what you pay for, and that's where I went wrong. If it's too good to be true it most likely is."
Kata chaos,Didn't come with 250g external drive.,Was supposed to be a bundle including 250g external side and did not come with it.
tiyanachapman,Great Laptop!,"This laptop is fast and efficient. I mainly use it for working at home and it helps me get the job done. It is smaller than expected, but it’s not an issue for me. I highly recommend getting this laptop."
JT5000,Nice price nice product,happy with purchase and the seller. I bought an open box for $60 less and it's great.
G Demling,HP laptop,Delivered before expected; very similar to my previous laptop; great screen size.
RenegadeFJB,Misrepresented,"Seller sold as new laptop. When trying to setup, HP claims ""out of warranty"" even though purchased on Jan. 30, 2023. HP claims warranty expired Nov 2022, which I have disputed. This normally wouldn't be a big deal, but you cannot set up the laptop because the Microsoft 365 that came on it is apparently expired or non-existent, which prevents the setup process altogether. I will be returning said laptop if support is not able to rectify."
Melissa Garcia,Great price!! My son loves it!!,My son uses it for school.
luis fernandez v,good product,"Good size, thin, good keyboard"
Malcolm,A lemon right out of the box,"When I opened up the computer and turned it on, NOTHING! I got a black screen that said something about the BIOS being corrupt. No matter what I tried, I could not get the thing to work. I reset it, restored it and nothing."
Amazon Customer,Product not working,"This laptop was just delivered 3 days ago. It won't set-up and the HP website says the warranty expired in November, 2022. Not happy as this is a gift for my wife."
Semper Fidelis,System corrupt out of the box. 5 Hours trying to get support!!,Nonfunctional out of the box. Support was extremely frustrating!!! Spent over 5 hours trying to understand foreign HP support staff. Will never purchase HP again.
Elmo,Awful display. Returned!,The display was so bad it has to be defective! Returned it! It’s also very cheaply made which I do not see lasting a long time at all.
Heather Wagner,Maybe I just got a lemon.,"From the 1st time I turned the computer on it gave me an error message and shutdown. Later, when I went to login and delete my account the computer would not turn on at all."
Amazon Customer,Computadora bloqueada,"Compré la computadora totalmente nueva, y al encender la computadora me solicita un usuario, como si ya hubiera tenido un dueño anterior entonces NO puedo ingresar. Y por si fuera poco dice que no se puede actualizar mi computadora."
sayed naser,overall quality build quality is not good,"don’t like the build quality, feel like it’s going to break. keyboard are very wired. screen are not very good"
alfred,Backlight went out in only 2 months after purchase!,Black screen 2 weeks after return window closed! Unacceptable. Do not purchase.
Myra,Got this for someone for christmas,The person that received said just what she wanted
